    "description": "# Soehnle Kitchen Scale Platter\n\nI have a Soehnle kitchen scale which has a glass platter on top which is glued to a adaptor which is screwed into the base. The glass detached from the adaptor and after failed attempts of gluing it back on with superglue and epoxy, which both didn't last very long, I designed a replacement for the whole glass plate.\n\nIt just snaps onto the adaptor with little force but is held strong enough to not detach on it's own. The design is parametric so if it's too lose or snug for your scale, try playing around with the `holder_diameter` and `holder_overhang` parameters.\n\n## GitHub\n\nhttps://github.com/nomike/soehnle_kitchen_scale_platter\n\n## Thingiverse\n\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6528263\n",
